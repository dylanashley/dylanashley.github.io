Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student with [Professor JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](http://idsia.ch/~juergen) at the Swiss AI Lab [IDSIA](http://www.idsia.ch/). I completed my M.Sc. in the [Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) under the supervision of [Professor Richard Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net) of the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca). During my M.Sc., I served for a year as the Vice-President Academic of the [Graduate Students' Association](https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-students-association). Before all of this, I was a B.Sc. student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, and before that, I was a High School student in South Africa.

Most of my research focuses on various topics related to a particular branch of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning, though I'm interested in Machine Learning more broadly. You can find a list of my publications [here](research).

When my research gives me a free moment, you can often find me working to become a better amateur photographer. You can check out my portfolio [here](https://adobe.ly/2GorElp).
