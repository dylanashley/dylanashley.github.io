Hi! I'm an M.Sc. student in the [Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca) at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). I work with [Professor Richard Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net) of the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca). I'm also currently the Vice-President Academic of the [Graduate Students' Association](https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-students-association). Before all of this, I was a B.Sc. student in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, and before that, I was a High School student in South Africa.

I'm mainly interested in topics related to a branch of Artificial Intelligence called Reinforcement Learning. I'm also generally interested in Machine Learning more broadly. My [publications](publications) give a good snapshot of the kind of research I enjoy.
