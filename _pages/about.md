Hi! I'm a Ph.D. student with [Professor JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) at the [Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research](https://www.idsia.ch/) and an occasional visiting researcher at the [King Abdullah University of Science and Technology](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en). I previously completed my M.Sc. under the supervision of [Professor Richard Sutton](http://www.incompleteideas.net) of the [Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute](https://www.amii.ca). During my M.Sc., I served for a year as the Vice-President Academic of the [Graduate Students' Association](https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-students-association).

I'm broadly interested in Machine Learning, but most of my research focuses on topics related to Artificial Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning. You can find a list of my publications [here](research).

When my research gives me a free moment, you can often find me working to become a better amateur photographer. You can check out my portfolio [here](https://adobe.ly/2GorElp).
