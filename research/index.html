    <p>This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability
                    of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned
                    Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms
                    performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic
                    tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific
                    environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation
                    for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching
                    reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling.
                    At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the
                    underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal
                    solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in
                    situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise.
                    Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of
                    command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective
                    depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision
                    Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the
                    transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a
                    deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with
                    respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both
                    asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The
                    developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on
                    the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the
                    underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a
                    number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in
                    segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the
                    application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The
                    theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example
                    environments and numerical experiments.</p>

    <p>The act of telling stories is a fundamental part of what it means to be
                    human. This work introduces the concept of narrative information, which
                    we define as the overlap in information space between a story and the
                    items that compose the story. Using contrastive learning methods, we
                    show how modern artificial neural networks can be leveraged to distill
                    stories and extract a representation of the narrative information. We
                    then demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can leverage this to
                    extract a set of narrative template curves and how these – in tandem
                    with a novel curve-fitting algorithm we introduce – can reorder music
                    albums to automatically induce stories in them. In doing so, we give
                    statistically significant evidence that (1) these narrative information
                    template curves are present in existing albums and that (2) people
                    prefer an album ordered through one of these learned template curves
                    over a random one. The premises of our work extend to any form of
                    (largely) independent media, and as evidence, we also show that our
                    method works with image data.</p>

    <p>Upside Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL) is a promising framework for
                    solving reinforcement learning problems which focuses on learning
                    command-conditioned policies. In this work, we extend UDRL to the task
                    of learning a command-conditioned generator of deep neural network
                    policies. We accomplish this using Hypernetworks - a variant of Fast
                    Weight Programmers, which learn to decode input commands representing a
                    desired expected return into command-specific weight matrices. Our
                    method, dubbed Upside Down Reinforcement Learning with Policy Generators
                    (UDRLPG), streamlines comparable techniques by removing the need for an
                    evaluator or critic to update the weights of the generator. To
                    counteract the increased variance in last returns caused by not having
                    an evaluator, we decouple the sampling probability of the buffer from
                    the absolute number of policies in it, which, together with a simple
                    weighting strategy, improves the empirical convergence of the algorithm.
                    Compared with existing algorithms, UDRLPG achieves competitive
                    performance and high returns, sometimes outperforming more complex
                    architectures. Our experiments show that a trained generator can
                    generalize to create policies that achieve unseen returns zero-shot. The
                    proposed method appears to be effective in mitigating some of the
                    challenges associated with learning highly multimodal functions.
                    Altogether, we believe that UDRLPG represents a promising step forward
                    in achieving greater empirical sample efficiency in RL. A full
                    implementation of UDRLPG is publicly available at
                    https://github.com/JacopoD/udrlpg_</p>

    <p>Language-based agentic systems have shown great promise in recent years,
                    transitioning from solving small-scale research problems to being
                    deployed in challenging real-world tasks. However, optimizing these
                    systems often requires substantial manual labor. Recent studies have
                    demonstrated that these systems can be represented as computational
                    graphs, enabling automatic optimization. Despite these advancements,
                    most current efforts in Graph-based Agentic System Optimization (GASO)
                    fail to properly assign feedback to the system’s components given
                    feedback on the system’s output. To address this challenge, we formalize
                    the concept of semantic backpropagation with semantic gradients – a
                    generalization that aligns several key optimization techniques,
                    including reverse-mode automatic differentiation and the more recent
                    TextGrad by exploiting the relationship among nodes with a common
                    successor. This serves as a method for computing directional information
                    about how changes to each component of an agentic system might improve
                    the system’s output. To use these gradients, we propose a method called
                    semantic gradient descent which enables us to solve GASO effectively.
                    Our results on both BIG-Bench Hard and GSM8K show that our approach
                    outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for solving GASO problems.
                    A detailed ablation study on the LIAR dataset demonstrates the
                    parsimonious nature of our method. A full copy of our implementation is

    <p>Album sequencing is a critical part of the album production process.
                    Recently, a data-driven approach was proposed that sequences general
                    collections of independent media by extracting the narrative essence of
                    the items in the collections. While this approach implies an album
                    sequencing technique, it is not widely accessible to a less technical
                    audience, requiring advanced knowledge of machine learning techniques to
                    use. To address this, we introduce a new user-friendly web-based tool
                    that allows a less technical audience to upload music tracks, execute
                    this technique in one click, and subsequently presents the result in a
                    clean visualization to the user. To both increase the number of
                    templates available to the user and address shortcomings of previous
                    work, we also introduce a new direct transformer-based album sequencing
                    method. We find that our more direct method outperforms a random
                    baseline but does not reach the same performance as the narrative
                    essence approach. Both methods are included in our web-based user
                    interface, and this – alongside a full copy of our implementation – is
                    publicly available at

    <p>Contemporary evaluation techniques are inadequate for agentic systems.
                    These approaches either focus exclusively on final outcomes – ignoring
                    the step-by-step nature of agentic systems, or require excessive manual
                    labour. To address this, we introduce the Agent-as-a-Judge framework,
                    wherein agentic systems are used to evaluate agentic systems. This is an
                    organic extension of the LLM-as-a-Judge framework, incorporating agentic
                    features that enable intermediate feedback for the entire task-solving
                    process. We apply the Agent-as-a-Judge to the task of code generation.
                    To overcome issues with existing benchmarks and provide a
                    proof-of-concept testbed for Agent-as-a-Judge, we present DevAI, a new
                    benchmark of 55 realistic automated AI development tasks. It includes
                    rich manual annotations, like a total of 365 hierarchical user
                    requirements. We benchmark three of the popular agentic systems using
                    Agent-as-a-Judge and find it dramatically outperforms LLM-as-a-Judge and
                    is as reliable as our human evaluation baseline. Altogether, we believe
                    that Agent-as-a-Judge marks a concrete step forward for modern agentic
                    systems – by providing rich and reliable reward signals necessary for
                    dynamic and scalable self-improvement.</p>

    <p>The Value Iteration Network (VIN) is an end-to-end differentiable
                    architecture that performs value iteration on a latent Markov Decision
                    Process (MDP) for planning in reinforcement learning (RL). However, VINs
                    struggle to scale to long-term and large-scale planning tasks, such as
                    navigating a 100x100 maze – a task that typically requires thousands of
                    planning steps to solve. We observe that this deficiency is due to two
                    issues: the representation capacity of the latent MDP and the planning
                    module’s depth. We address these by augmenting the latent MDP with a
                    dynamic transition kernel, dramatically improving its representational
                    capacity, and, to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, introduce an
                    "adaptive highway loss" that constructs skip connections to improve
                    gradient flow. We evaluate our method on 2D maze navigation
                    environments, the ViZDoom 3D navigation benchmark, and the real-world
                    Lunar rover navigation task. We find that our new method, named Dynamic
                    Transition VIN (DT-VIN), scales to 5000 layers and solves challenging
                    versions of the above tasks. Altogether, we believe that DT-VIN
                    represents a concrete step forward in performing long-term large-scale
                    planning in RL environments.</p>

    <p>Advanced machine learning algorithms require platforms that are
                    extremely robust and equipped with rich sensory feedback to handle
                    extensive trial-and-error learning without relying on strong inductive
                    biases. Traditional robotic designs, while well-suited for their
                    specific use cases, are often fragile when used with these algorithms.
                    To address this gap – and inspired by the vision of enabling
                    curiosity-driven baby robots – we present a novel robotic limb designed
                    from scratch. Our design has a hybrid soft-hard structure, high
                    redundancy with rich non-contact sensors (exclusively cameras), and
                    easily replaceable failure points. Proof-of-concept experiments using
                    two contemporary reinforcement learning algorithms on a physical
                    prototype demonstrate that our design is able to succeed in a simple
                    target-finding task even under simulated sensor failures, all with
                    minimal human oversight during extended learning periods. We believe
                    this design represents a concrete step toward more tailored robotic
                    designs for achieving general-purpose, generally intelligent robots.</p>

    <p>Both Minsky’s "society of mind" and Schmidhuber’s "learning to think"
                    inspire diverse societies of large multimodal neural networks (NNs)
                    that solve problems by interviewing each other in a "mindstorm." Recent
                    implementations of NN-based societies of minds consist of large
                    language models (LLMs) and other NN-based experts communicating through
                    a natural language interface. In doing so, they overcome the
                    limitations of single LLMs, improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning.
                    In these natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs), new agents
                    – all communicating through the same universal symbolic language –
                    are easily added in a modular fashion. To demonstrate the power of
                    NLSOMs, we assemble and experiment with several of them (having up to
                    129 members), leveraging mindstorms in them to solve some practical AI
                    tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image
                    synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and
                    general language-based task solving. We view this as a starting point
                    towards much larger NLSOMs with billions of agents-some of which may be
                    humans. And with this emergence of great societies of heterogeneous
                    minds, many new research questions have suddenly become paramount to
                    the future of artificial intelligence. What should be the social
                    structure of an NLSOM? What would be the (dis)advantages of having a
                    monarchical rather than a democratic structure? How can principles of
                    NN economies be used to maximize the total reward of a reinforcement
                    learning NLSOM? In this work, we identify, discuss, and try to answer
                    some of these questions.</p>

    <p>The Languini Kitchen serves as both a research collective and codebase
                    designed to empower researchers with limited computational resources to
                    contribute meaningfully to the field of language modelling. We
                    introduce an experimental protocol that enables model comparisons based
                    on equivalent compute, measured in accelerator hours. The number of
                    tokens on which a model is trained is defined by the model’s throughput
                    and the chosen compute class. Notably, this approach avoids constraints
                    on critical hyperparameters which affect total parameters or
                    floating-point operations. For evaluation, we pre-process an existing
                    large, diverse, and high-quality dataset of books that surpasses
                    existing academic benchmarks in quality, diversity, and document
                    length. On it, we compare methods based on their empirical scaling
                    trends which are estimated through experiments at various levels of
                    compute. This work also provides two baseline models: a feed-forward
                    model derived from the GPT-2 architecture and a recurrent model in the
                    form of a novel LSTM with ten-fold throughput. While the GPT baseline
                    achieves better perplexity throughout all our levels of compute, our
                    LSTM baseline exhibits a predictable and more favourable scaling law.
                    This is due to the improved throughput and the need for fewer training
                    tokens to achieve the same decrease in test perplexity. Extrapolating
                    the scaling laws leads of both models results in an intersection at
                    roughly 50,000 accelerator hours. We hope this work can serve as the
                    foundation for meaningful and reproducible language modelling research.</p>

  <span class="abstract hidden">
    <p>Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning (UDRL) is an approach for solving RL
                    problems that does not require value functions and uses only supervised
                    learning, where the targets for given inputs in a dataset do not change
                    over time. Ghosh et al. proved that Goal-Conditional Supervised
                    Learning (GCSL) – which can be viewed as a simplified version of UDRL
                    – optimizes a lower bound on goal-reaching performance. This raises
                    expectations that such algorithms may enjoy guaranteed convergence to
                    the optimal policy in arbitrary environments, similar to certain
                    well-known traditional RL algorithms. Here we show that for a specific
                    episodic UDRL algorithm (eUDRL, including GCSL), this is not the case,
                    and give the causes of this limitation. To do so, we first introduce a
                    helpful rewrite of eUDRL as a recursive policy update. This formulation
                    helps to disprove its convergence to the optimal policy for a wide
                    class of stochastic environments. Finally, we provide a concrete
                    example of a very simple environment where eUDRL diverges. Since the
                    primary aim of this paper is to present a negative result, and the best
                    counterexamples are the simplest ones, we restrict all discussions to
                    finite (discrete) environments, ignoring issues of function
                    approximation and limited sample size.</p>

    <p>Lately, there has been a resurgence of interest in using supervised
                    learning to solve reinforcement learning problems. Recent work in this
                    area has largely focused on learning command-conditioned policies. We
                    investigate the potential of one such method – upside-down
                    reinforcement learning – to work with commands that specify a desired
                    relationship between some scalar value and the observed return. We show
                    that upside-down reinforcement learning can learn to carry out such
                    commands online in a tabular bandit setting and in CartPole with
                    non-linear function approximation. By doing so, we demonstrate the
                    power of this family of methods and open the way for their practical
                    use under more complicated command structures.</p>

    <p>Upside down reinforcement learning (UDRL) flips the conventional use of
                    the return in the objective function in RL upside down, by taking
                    returns as input and predicting actions. UDRL is based purely on
                    supervised learning, and bypasses some prominent issues in RL:
                    bootstrapping, off-policy corrections, and discount factors. While
                    previous work with UDRL demonstrated it in a traditional online RL
                    setting, here we show that this single algorithm can also work in the
                    imitation learning and offline RL settings, be extended to the
                    goal-conditioned RL setting, and even the meta-RL setting. With a
                    general agent architecture, a single UDRL agent can learn across all
                    paradigms.</p>

    <p>Reward-Weighted Regression (RWR) belongs to a family of widely known
                    iterative Reinforcement Learning algorithms based on the
                    Expectation-Maximization framework. In this family, learning at each
                    iteration consists of sampling a batch of trajectories using the
                    current policy and fitting a new policy to maximize a return-weighted
                    log-likelihood of actions. Although RWR is known to yield monotonic
                    improvement of the policy under certain circumstances, whether and
                    under which conditions RWR converges to the optimal policy have
                    remained open questions. In this paper, we provide for the first time a
                    proof that RWR converges to a global optimum when no function
                    approximation is used, in a general compact setting. Furthermore, for
                    the simpler case with finite state and action spaces we prove R-linear
                    convergence of the state-value function to the optimum.</p>

    <p>Catastrophic forgetting remains a severe hindrance to the broad
                    application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues
                    to be a poorly understood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of
                    work on catastrophic forgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how
                    exactly the phenomenon should be quantified, and, moreover, to what
                    degree all of the choices we make when designing learning systems
                    affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use various testbeds
                    from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning literature to
                    (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern gradient-based
                    optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant impact
                    on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show
                    that-surprisingly-in many instances classical algorithms such as
                    vanilla SGD experience less catastrophic forgetting than the more
                    modern algorithms such as Adam. We empirically compare four different
                    existing metrics for quantifying catastrophic forgetting and (2) show
                    that the degree to which the learning systems experience catastrophic
                    forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the metric used that a change
                    from one principled metric to another is enough to change the
                    conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much
                    more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at
                    catastrophic forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task
                    forgetting in supervised learning must be measured with both retention
                    and relearning metrics concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in
                    reinforcement learning must-at the very least-be measured with pairwise
                    interference.</p>

    <p><p>This thesis is offered as a step forward in our understanding of
                    forgetting in artificial neural networks. ANNs are a learning system
                    loosely based on our understanding of the brain and are responsible for
                    recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. However, they have
                    been reported to be particularly susceptible to forgetting.
                    Specifically, existing research suggests that ANNs may exhibit
                    unexpectedly high rates of retroactive inhibition when compared with
                    results from psychology studies measuring forgetting in people. If this
                    phenomenon, dubbed catastrophic forgetting, exists, then explicit
                    methods intended to reduce it may increase the scope of problems ANNs
                    can be successfully applied to.</p>

                    <p>In this thesis, we contribute to the field by answering five questions
                    related to forgetting in ANNs: How does forgetting in psychology relate
                    to ideas in machine learning? What is catastrophic forgetting? Does it
                    exist in contemporary systems, and, if so, is it severe? How can we
                    measure a system’s susceptibility to it? Are the current optimization
                    algorithms we use to train ANNs adding to its severity?</p>

                    <p>This work answers each of the five questions sequentially. We begin by
                    answering the first and second of the five questions by providing an
                    analytical survey that looks at the concept of forgetting as it appears
                    in psychology and connects it to various ideas in machine learning such
                    as generalization, transfer learning, experience replay, and
                    eligibility traces.</p>

                    <p>We subsequently confirm the existence and severity of catastrophic
                    forgetting in some contemporary machine learning systems by showing
                    that it appears when a simple, modern ANN (multi-layered
                    fully-connected network with rectified linear unit activation) is
                    trained using a conventional algorithm (Stochastic Gradient Descent
                    through backpropagation with normal random initialization)
                    incrementally on a well-known multi-class classification setting
                    (MNIST). We demonstrate that the phenomenon is a more subtle problem
                    than a simple reversal of learning. We accomplish this by noting that
                    both total learning time and relearning time are reduced when the
                    multi-class classification problem is split into multiple phases
                    containing samples from disjoint subsets of the classes.</p>

                    <p>We then move on to looking at how we can measure the degree to which
                    ANN-based learning systems suffer from catastrophic forgetting by
                    constructing a principled testbed out of the previous multi-task
                    supervised learning problem and two well-studied reinforcement learning
                    problems (Mountain Car and Acrobot). We apply this testbed to answer
                    the final of the five questions by looking at how several modern
                    gradient-based optimization algorithms used to train ANNs (SGD, SGD
                    with Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam) affect the amount of catastrophic
                    forgetting that occurs during training. While doing so, we are able to
                    confirm and expand previous hypotheses surrounding the complexities of
                    measuring catastrophic forgetting. We find that different algorithms,
                    even when applied to the same ANN, result in significantly different
                    amounts of catastrophic forgetting under a variety of different
                    metrics.</p>

                    <p>We believe that our answers to the five questions constitute a step
                    forward in our understanding of forgetting as it appears in ANNs. Such
                    an understanding is essential for realizing the full potential that
                    ANNs offer to the study of artificial intelligence.</p></p>

    <p>Transfer in Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to the idea of applying
                    knowledge gained from previous tasks to solving related tasks. Learning
                    a universal value function (Schaul et al., 2015), which generalizes
                    over goals and states, has previously been shown to be useful for
                    transfer. However, successor features are believed to be more suitable
                    than values for transfer (Dayan, 1993; Barreto et al., 2017), even
                    though they cannot directly generalize to new goals. In this paper, we
                    propose (1) Universal Successor Features (USFs) to capture the
                    underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing generalization to
                    unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model of USFs that can be
                    trained by interacting with the environment. We show that learning USFs
                    is compatible with any RL algorithm that learns state values using a
                    temporal difference method. Our experiments in a simple gridworld and
                    with two MuJoCo environments show that USFs can greatly accelerate
                    training when learning multiple tasks and can effectively transfer
                    knowledge to new tasks.</p>

    <p>Procedural content generation (PCG) is an active area of research with
                    the potential to significantly reduce game development costs as well as
                    create game experiences meaningfully personalized to each player.
                    Evolutionary methods are a promising method of generating content
                    procedurally. In particular asynchronous evolution of AI agents in an
                    artificial life (A-life) setting is notably similar to the online
                    evolution of non-playable characters in a video game. In this paper, we
                    are concerned with improving the efficiency of evolution via more
                    effective mate selection. In the spirit of PCG, we genetically encode
                    each agent’s preference for mating partners and thereby allowing the
                    mate-selection process to evolve. We evaluate this approach in a simple
                    predator-prey A-life environment and demonstrate that the ability to
                    evolve a per-agent mate-selection preference function indeed
                    significantly increases the extinction time of the population.
                    Additionally, an inspection of the evolved preference function
                    parameters shows that agents evolve to favor mates who have survival
                    traits.</p>

    <p>Artificial life (A-life) simulations present a natural way to study
                    interesting phenomena emerging in a population of evolving agents. In
                    this paper, we investigate whether allowing A-life agents to select
                    mates can extend the lifetime of a population. In our approach, each
                    agent evaluates potential mates via a preference function. The role of
                    this function is to map information about an agent and its candidate
                    mate to a scalar preference for deciding whether or not to form an
                    offspring. We encode the parameters of the preference function
                    genetically within each agent, thus allowing such preferences to be
                    agent-specific as well as evolving over time. We evaluate this approach

    <p>Temporal-difference (TD) learning methods are widely used in
                    reinforcement learning to estimate the expected return for each state,
                    without a model, because of their significant advantages in
                    computational and data efficiency. For many applications involving risk
                    mitigation, it would also be useful to estimate the <i>variance</i> of
                    the return by TD methods. In this paper, we describe a way of doing
                    this that is substantially simpler than those proposed by Tamar, Di
                    Castro, and Mannor in 2012, or those proposed by White and White in
                    2016. We show that two TD learners operating in series can learn
                    expectation and variance estimates. The trick is to use the square of
                    the TD error of the expectation learner as the reward of the variance
                    learner, and the square of the expectation learner’s discount rate as
                    the discount rate of the variance learner. With these two
                    modifications, the variance learning problem becomes a conventional TD
                    learning problem to which standard theoretical results can be applied.
                    Our formal results are limited to the table lookup case, for which our
                    method is still novel, but the extension to function approximation is
                    immediate, and we provide some empirical results for the linear
                    function approximation case. Our experimental results show that our
                    direct method behaves just as well as a comparable indirect method, but
                    is generally more robust.</p>

    <p>A proper evaluation of techniques that require multiple training and
                    evaluation executions of a benchmark, such as Feedback-Directed
                    Optimization (FDO), requires multiple workloads that can be used to
                    characterize variations on the behaviour of a program based on the
                    workload. This paper aims to improve the performance evaluation of
                    computer systems - including compilers, computer architecture
                    simulation, and operating-system prototypes - that rely on the
                    industrystandard SPEC CPU benchmark suite. A main concern with the use
                    of this suite in research is that it is distributed with a very small
                    number of workloads. This paper describes the process to create
                    additional workloads for this suite and offers useful insights in many
                    of its benchmarks. The set of additional workloads created, named the
                    Alberta Workloads for the SPEC CPU 2017 Benchmark Suite1 is made freely
                    available with the goal of providing additional data points for the
                    exploration of learning in computing systems. These workloads should
                    also contribute to ameliorate the hidden learning problem where a
                    researcher sets parameters to a system during development based on a
                    set of benchmarks and then evaluates the system using the very same set
                    of benchmarks with the very same workloads.</p>

    <p>This paper investigates estimating the variance of a
                    temporal-difference learning agent’s update target. Most reinforcement
                    learning methods use an estimate of the value function, which captures
                    how good it is for the agent to be in a particular state and is
                    mathematically expressed as the expected sum of discounted future
                    rewards (called the return). These values can be straightforwardly
                    estimated by averaging batches of returns using Monte Carlo methods.
                    However, if we wish to update the agent’s value estimates during
                    learning–before terminal outcomes are observed–we must use a
                    different estimation target called the λ-return, which
                    truncates the return with the agent’s own estimate of the value
                    function. Temporal difference learning methods estimate the expected
                    λ-return for each state, allowing these methods to update
                    online and incrementally, and in most cases achieve better
                    generalization error and faster learning than Monte Carlo methods.
                    Naturally one could attempt to estimate higher-order moments of the
                    λ-return. This paper is about estimating the variance of the
                    λ-return. Prior work has shown that given estimates of the
                    variance of the λ-return, learning systems can be constructed
                    to (1) mitigate risk in action selection, and (2) automatically adapt
                    the parameters of the learning process itself to improve performance.
                    Unfortunately, existing methods for estimating the variance of the
                    λ-return are complex and not well understood empirically. We
                    contribute a method for estimating the variance of the λ-return
                    directly using policy evaluation methods from reinforcement learning.
                    Our approach is significantly simpler than prior methods that
                    independently estimate the second moment of the λ-return.
                    Empirically our new approach behaves at least as well as existing
                    approaches, but is generally more robust.</p>
