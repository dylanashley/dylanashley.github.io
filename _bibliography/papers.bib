  abstract  = {This thesis is offered as a step forward in our understanding of forgetting in
               artificial neural networks. ANNs are a learning system loosely based on our
               understanding of the brain and are responsible for recent breakthroughs in
               artificial intelligence. However, they have been reported to be particularly
               susceptible to forgetting. Specifically, existing research suggests that ANNs
               may exhibit unexpectedly high rates of retroactive inhibition when compared
               with results from psychology studies measuring forgetting in people. If this
               phenomenon, dubbed catastrophic forgetting, exists, then explicit methods
               intended to reduce it may increase the scope of problems ANNs can be
               successfully applied to.

               In this thesis, we contribute to the field by answering five questions related
               to forgetting in ANNs: How does forgetting in psychology relate to ideas in
               machine learning? What is catastrophic forgetting? Does it exist in
               contemporary systems, and, if so, is it severe? How can we measure a system's
               susceptibility to it? Are the current optimization algorithms we use to train
               ANNs adding to its severity?

               This work answers each of the five questions sequentially. We begin by
               answering the first and second of the five questions by providing an analytical
               survey that looks at the concept of forgetting as it appears in psychology and
               connects it to various ideas in machine learning such as generalization,
               transfer learning, experience replay, and eligibility traces.

               We subsequently confirm the existence and severity of catastrophic forgetting
               in some contemporary machine learning systems by showing that it appears when a
               simple, modern ANN (multi-layered fully-connected network with rectified linear
               unit activation) is trained using a conventional algorithm (Stochastic Gradient
               Descent through backpropagation with normal random initialization)
               incrementally on a well-known multi-class classification setting (MNIST). We
               demonstrate that the phenomenon is a more subtle problem than a simple reversal
               of learning. We accomplish this by noting that both total learning time and
               relearning time are reduced when the multi-class classification problem is
               split into multiple phases containing samples from disjoint subsets of the
               classes.

               We then move on to looking at how we can measure the degree to which ANN-based
               learning systems suffer from catastrophic forgetting by constructing a
               principled testbed out of the previous multi-task supervised learning problem
               and two well-studied reinforcement learning problems (Mountain Car and
               Acrobot). We apply this testbed to answer the final of the five questions by
               looking at how several modern gradient-based optimization algorithms used to
               train ANNs (SGD, SGD with Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam) affect the amount of
               catastrophic forgetting that occurs during training. While doing so, we are
               able to confirm and expand previous hypotheses surrounding the complexities of
               measuring catastrophic forgetting. We find that different algorithms, even when
               applied to the same ANN, result in significantly different amounts of
               catastrophic forgetting under a variety of different metrics.

               We believe that our answers to the five questions constitute a step forward in
               our understanding of forgetting as it appears in ANNs. Such an understanding is
               essential for realizing the full potential that ANNs offer to the study of
               artificial intelligence.},

  abstract  = {Transfer in Reinforcement Learning (RL) refers to the idea of applying
               knowledge gained from previous tasks to solving related tasks. Learning a
               universal value function (Schaul et al., 2015), which generalizes over goals
               and states, has previously been shown to be useful for transfer. However,
               successor features are believed to be more suitable than values for transfer
               (Dayan, 1993; Barreto et al., 2017), even though they cannot directly
               generalize to new goals. In this paper, we propose (1) Universal Successor
               Features (USFs) to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment while
               allowing generalization to unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model of
               USFs that can be trained by interacting with the environment. We show that
               learning USFs is compatible with any RL algorithm that learns state values
               using a temporal difference method. Our experiments in a simple gridworld and
               with two MuJoCo environments show that USFs can greatly accelerate training
               when learning multiple tasks and can effectively transfer knowledge to new
               tasks.},

               potential to significantly reduce game development costs as well as create game
               experiences meaningfully personalized to each player. Evolutionary methods are
               a promising method of generating content procedurally. In particular
               asynchronous evolution of AI agents in an artificial life (A-life) setting is
               notably similar to the online evolution of non-playable characters in a video
               game. In this paper, we are concerned with improving the efficiency of
               evolution via more effective mate selection. In the spirit of PCG, we
               genetically encode each agent's preference for mating partners and thereby
               allowing the mate-selection process to evolve. We evaluate this approach in a

  abstract  = {Temporal-difference (TD) learning methods are widely used in reinforcement
               learning to estimate the expected return for each state, without a model,
               because of their significant advantages in computational and data efficiency.
               For many applications involving risk mitigation, it would also be useful to
               estimate the \emph{variance} of the return by TD methods. In this paper, we
               describe a way of doing this that is substantially simpler than those proposed
               by Tamar, Di Castro, and Mannor in 2012, or those proposed by White and White
               in 2016. We show that two TD learners operating in series can learn expectation
               and variance estimates. The trick is to use the square of the TD error of the
               expectation learner as the reward of the variance learner, and the square of
               the expectation learner’s discount rate as the discount rate of the variance
               learner. With these two modifications, the variance learning problem becomes a
               conventional TD learning problem to which standard theoretical results can be
               applied. Our formal results are limited to the table lookup case, for which our
               method is still novel, but the extension to function approximation is
               immediate, and we provide some empirical results for the linear function
               approximation case. Our experimental results show that our direct method
               behaves just as well as a comparable indirect method, but is generally more
               robust.},

  abstract  = {This paper investigates estimating the variance of a temporal-difference
               learning agent's update target. Most reinforcement learning methods use an
               estimate of the value function, which captures how good it is for the agent to
               be in a particular state and is mathematically expressed as the expected sum of
               discounted future rewards (called the return). These values can be
               straightforwardly estimated by averaging batches of returns using Monte Carlo
               methods. However, if we wish to update the agent's value estimates during
               learning--before terminal outcomes are observed--we must use a different
               estimation target called the {\lambda}-return, which truncates the return with
               the agent's own estimate of the value function. Temporal difference learning
               methods estimate the expected {\lambda}-return for each state, allowing these
               methods to update online and incrementally, and in most cases achieve better
               generalization error and faster learning than Monte Carlo methods. Naturally
               one could attempt to estimate higher-order moments of the {\lambda}-return.
               This paper is about estimating the variance of the {\lambda}-return. Prior work
               has shown that given estimates of the variance of the {\lambda}-return,
               learning systems can be constructed to (1) mitigate risk in action selection,
               and (2) automatically adapt the parameters of the learning process itself to
               improve performance. Unfortunately, existing methods for estimating the
               variance of the {\lambda}-return are complex and not well understood
               empirically. We contribute a method for estimating the variance of the
               {\lambda}-return directly using policy evaluation methods from reinforcement
               learning. Our approach is significantly simpler than prior methods that
               independently estimate the second moment of the {\lambda}-return. Empirically
               our new approach behaves at least as well as existing approaches, but is
               generally more robust.},
