                    application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), however, it continues
                    to be a poorly understood phenomenon. Despite the extensive amount of
                    work on catastrophic forgetting, we argue that it is still unclear how
                    exactly the phenomenon should be quantified, and, moreover, to what
                    degree all of the choices we make when designing learning systems
                    affect the amount of catastrophic forgetting. We use various testbeds
                    from the reinforcement learning and supervised learning literature to
                    (1) provide evidence that the choice of which modern gradient-based
                    optimization algorithm is used to train an ANN has a significant impact
                    on the amount of catastrophic forgetting and show
                    that--surprisingly--in many instances classical algorithms such as
                    vanilla SGD experience less catastrophic forgetting than the more
                    modern algorithms such as Adam. We empirically compare four different
                    existing metrics for quantifying catastrophic forgetting and (2) show
                    that the degree to which the learning systems experience catastrophic
                    forgetting is sufficiently sensitive to the metric used that a change
                    from one principled metric to another is enough to change the
                    conclusions of a study dramatically. Our results suggest that a much
                    more rigorous experimental methodology is required when looking at
                    catastrophic forgetting. Based on our results, we recommend inter-task
                    forgetting in supervised learning must be measured with both retention
                    and relearning metrics concurrently, and intra-task forgetting in
                    reinforcement learning must--at the very least--be measured with
                    pairwise interference.},

@article{ashley2020understanding,
    abstract     = {This thesis is offered as a step forward in our understanding of
                    forgetting in artificial neural networks. ANNs are a learning system
                    loosely based on our understanding of the brain and are responsible for
                    recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence. However, they have
                    been reported to be particularly susceptible to forgetting.
                    Specifically, existing research suggests that ANNs may exhibit
                    unexpectedly high rates of retroactive inhibition when compared with
                    results from psychology studies measuring forgetting in people. If this
                    phenomenon, dubbed catastrophic forgetting, exists, then explicit
                    methods intended to reduce it may increase the scope of problems ANNs
                    can be successfully applied to.

                    In this thesis, we contribute to the field by answering five questions
                    related to forgetting in ANNs: How does forgetting in psychology relate
                    to ideas in machine learning? What is catastrophic forgetting? Does it
                    exist in contemporary systems, and, if so, is it severe? How can we
                    measure a system's susceptibility to it? Are the current optimization
                    algorithms we use to train ANNs adding to its severity?

                    This work answers each of the five questions sequentially. We begin by
                    answering the first and second of the five questions by providing an
                    analytical survey that looks at the concept of forgetting as it appears
                    in psychology and connects it to various ideas in machine learning such
                    as generalization, transfer learning, experience replay, and
                    eligibility traces.

                    We subsequently confirm the existence and severity of catastrophic
                    forgetting in some contemporary machine learning systems by showing
                    that it appears when a simple, modern ANN (multi-layered
                    fully-connected network with rectified linear unit activation) is
                    trained using a conventional algorithm (Stochastic Gradient Descent
                    through backpropagation with normal random initialization)
                    incrementally on a well-known multi-class classification setting
                    (MNIST). We demonstrate that the phenomenon is a more subtle problem
                    than a simple reversal of learning. We accomplish this by noting that
                    both total learning time and relearning time are reduced when the
                    multi-class classification problem is split into multiple phases
                    containing samples from disjoint subsets of the classes.

                    We then move on to looking at how we can measure the degree to which
                    ANN-based learning systems suffer from catastrophic forgetting by
                    constructing a principled testbed out of the previous multi-task
                    supervised learning problem and two well-studied reinforcement learning
                    problems (Mountain Car and Acrobot). We apply this testbed to answer
                    the final of the five questions by looking at how several modern
                    gradient-based optimization algorithms used to train ANNs (SGD, SGD
                    with Momentum, RMSProp, and Adam) affect the amount of catastrophic
                    forgetting that occurs during training. While doing so, we are able to
                    confirm and expand previous hypotheses surrounding the complexities of
                    measuring catastrophic forgetting. We find that different algorithms,
                    even when applied to the same ANN, result in significantly different
                    amounts of catastrophic forgetting under a variety of different
                    metrics.

                    We believe that our answers to the five questions constitute a step
                    forward in our understanding of forgetting as it appears in ANNs. Such
                    an understanding is essential for realizing the full potential that
                    ANNs offer to the study of artificial intelligence.},

                    a universal value function (Schaul et al., 2015), which generalizes
                    over goals and states, has previously been shown to be useful for
                    transfer. However, successor features are believed to be more suitable
                    than values for transfer (Dayan, 1993; Barreto et al., 2017), even
                    though they cannot directly generalize to new goals. In this paper, we
                    propose (1) Universal Successor Features (USFs) to capture the
                    underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing generalization to
                    unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model of USFs that can be
                    trained by interacting with the environment. We show that learning USFs
                    is compatible with any RL algorithm that learns state values using a
                    temporal difference method. Our experiments in a simple gridworld and
                    with two MuJoCo environments show that USFs can greatly accelerate
                    training when learning multiple tasks and can effectively transfer
                    knowledge to new tasks.},

                    the potential to significantly reduce game development costs as well as
                    create game experiences meaningfully personalized to each player.
                    Evolutionary methods are a promising method of generating content
                    procedurally. In particular asynchronous evolution of AI agents in an

                    are concerned with improving the efficiency of evolution via more
                    effective mate selection. In the spirit of PCG, we genetically encode
                    each agent's preference for mating partners and thereby allowing the

                    mates can extend the lifetime of a population. In our approach, each

                    reinforcement learning to estimate the expected return for each state,
                    without a model, because of their significant advantages in
                    computational and data efficiency. For many applications involving risk
                    mitigation, it would also be useful to estimate the \emph{variance} of
                    the return by TD methods. In this paper, we describe a way of doing
                    this that is substantially simpler than those proposed by Tamar, Di
                    Castro, and Mannor in 2012, or those proposed by White and White in
                    2016. We show that two TD learners operating in series can learn
                    expectation and variance estimates. The trick is to use the square of
                    the TD error of the expectation learner as the reward of the variance
                    learner, and the square of the expectation learner’s discount rate as
                    the discount rate of the variance learner. With these two
                    modifications, the variance learning problem becomes a conventional TD
                    learning problem to which standard theoretical results can be applied.
                    Our formal results are limited to the table lookup case, for which our
                    method is still novel, but the extension to function approximation is
                    immediate, and we provide some empirical results for the linear
                    function approximation case. Our experimental results show that our
                    direct method behaves just as well as a comparable indirect method, but
                    is generally more robust.},

                    temporal-difference learning agent's update target. Most reinforcement
                    learning methods use an estimate of the value function, which captures
                    how good it is for the agent to be in a particular state and is
                    mathematically expressed as the expected sum of discounted future
                    rewards (called the return). These values can be straightforwardly
                    estimated by averaging batches of returns using Monte Carlo methods.
                    However, if we wish to update the agent's value estimates during
                    learning--before terminal outcomes are observed--we must use a
                    different estimation target called the {\lambda}-return, which
                    truncates the return with the agent's own estimate of the value
                    function. Temporal difference learning methods estimate the expected
                    {\lambda}-return for each state, allowing these methods to update
                    online and incrementally, and in most cases achieve better
                    generalization error and faster learning than Monte Carlo methods.
                    Naturally one could attempt to estimate higher-order moments of the
                    {\lambda}-return. This paper is about estimating the variance of the
                    {\lambda}-return. Prior work has shown that given estimates of the
                    variance of the {\lambda}-return, learning systems can be constructed
                    to (1) mitigate risk in action selection, and (2) automatically adapt
                    the parameters of the learning process itself to improve performance.
                    Unfortunately, existing methods for estimating the variance of the
                    {\lambda}-return are complex and not well understood empirically. We
                    contribute a method for estimating the variance of the {\lambda}-return
                    directly using policy evaluation methods from reinforcement learning.
                    Our approach is significantly simpler than prior methods that
                    independently estimate the second moment of the {\lambda}-return.
                    Empirically our new approach behaves at least as well as existing
                    approaches, but is generally more robust.},
